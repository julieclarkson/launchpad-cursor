# Review Timeline

Analyze the captured case study data and identify what's strong and what needs more content.

## Workflow

1. Read `.case-study/events.json` and parse all events.
2. Get recent git log for context:

```bash
git log --oneline -20
```

3. Categorize the events:
   - **Git metadata events**: How many commits are tracked?
   - **Reflections by promptId**: Which questions have been answered? How many times?
   - **Screenshots**: How many media assets exist?
   - **Manual events**: Any imported context from other tools?

4. Check coverage against both rubrics:

**Portfolio rubric:**
- [ ] Structured reasoning (constraints, tradeoffs, risks)
- [ ] Security awareness
- [ ] Systems thinking + architecture diagram
- [ ] Iteration evidence
- [ ] Real commits and decisions

**Marketing rubric:**
- [ ] Audience and pain points defined
- [ ] Positioning and differentiation
- [ ] Key messaging / value props
- [ ] Visual proof (screenshots)
- [ ] Distribution strategy
- [ ] Narrative arc (problem > solution > results)

5. Report findings as a clear status:

```
Case Study Status for [project-name]
=====================================
Events captured: 12
  - Git commits: 5
  - Reflections: 4 (constraints, tradeoffs, risks, iteration)
  - Screenshots: 2
  - Manual: 1

Coverage:
  [x] Constraints
  [x] Tradeoffs
  [x] Risks
  [ ] Security -- No security reflection captured yet
  [x] Iteration
  [ ] Architecture diagram -- Consider adding a Mermaid diagram

Suggestions:
  1. Add a security reflection -- you added auth middleware in commit abc1234
  2. Add an architecture diagram showing the system components
  3. Consider adding 1-2 more screenshots of the final UI
```

6. Offer to help fill gaps: "Want me to help capture a security reflection now?"
