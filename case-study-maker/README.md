# Case Study Maker

A Cursor plugin that tracks your build process, prompts reflection questions at the right moments, and generates portfolio and marketing case studies from your development journey.

**No API keys. No cloud. No cost.** Runs entirely on Cursor's built-in AI within your project folder.

[casestudymaker.dev](https://casestudymaker.dev) — Premium themes, PDF export, LinkedIn kit, and more.

---

## Install

Install from the [Cursor Marketplace](https://cursor.com/marketplace) by searching for **Case Study Maker**.

Or install directly from the repository:

1. Open Cursor Settings (Cmd+Shift+J)
2. Go to **Features** > **Plugins**
3. Add `https://github.com/julieclarkson/case-study-maker`

---

## Requirements

**Node.js** — Used by session-end and post-commit hooks for smart reminders (uncaptured commits, suggested reflection questions). If Node isn't installed, all other features work; you just won't get those automated prompts.

- **Check:** `node --version` (if you see a version like v20.x, you're set)
- **Install:** [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) or `brew install node` (macOS)

---

## Quick start

**Activation (choose one):**

### Option A: Via the Cursor plugin (recommended)
1. Open any project in Cursor (with the plugin enabled)
2. Type `/case-study` in the chat to see all available commands
3. Use `/activate-case-study-maker` to start tracking

### Option B: Via csm-init (when installed from GitHub)
If you cloned or downloaded the repo and added it as a plugin, you can also activate from the terminal:

```bash
cd /path/to/your-project
/path/to/case-study-maker/csm-init
```

Replace `/path/to/case-study-maker` with the actual path where you cloned the repo (e.g. `~/case-study-maker` or `~/.cursor/plugins/case-study-maker`). The script copies the rule and commands into your project so the AI partner and slash commands work in chat.

Once activated, a `.case-study/` directory is created in your project root. The plugin will notice significant development moments and suggest capturing reflections naturally in conversation.

## What it does

### Tracks your build process

An always-on rule watches your development flow and recognizes when you're making decisions worth documenting -- architecture tradeoffs, security considerations, constraint handling, risk mitigation, and iteration.

### Prompts reflection questions

Five core questions are surfaced at the right moments, never all at once:

| Question | Triggered by |
|----------|-------------|
| **Constraints** | Platform limits, budget, time pressure, tech stack decisions |
| **Tradeoffs** | "Chose X over Y", architecture decisions, library evaluations |
| **Risks** | Error handling, external APIs, data migration, infrastructure changes |
| **Security** | Auth, validation, encryption, CORS, user data handling |
| **Iteration** | Refactoring, rewrites, version changes, major restructuring |

### AI-assisted answers

Use `/auto-capture` to let the AI draft reflection answers from your conversation context. You review and approve before anything is saved.

### Generates case studies

Output formats, all as self-contained HTML/CSS/JS:

- **Portfolio** (`/generate-portfolio`) — For recruiters and hiring managers evaluating engineering judgment
- **Marketing** (`/generate-marketing`) — For marketers, founders, and customers evaluating product value
- **Portfolio card** (`/generate-portfolio-card`) — Embeddable card for your site
- **Custom categories** (`/generate-custom`) — Any category you install: pitch-deck, linkedin, etc. Add templates to `.case-study/templates/{category}/` and generate with `/generate {category}`.

## How data is stored

All data stays inside your project folder:

```
your-project/
├── .case-study/           # Added to .gitignore automatically
│   ├── events.json        # Append-only event log
│   ├── media/             # Screenshots and assets
│   └── pending.json       # Uncaptured reflection flags (auto-generated)
└── OUTPUTS/               # Generated case studies (commit to deploy)
    ├── portfolio_[project].html
    ├── portfolio_[project].css       # Layout (uses theme tokens)
    ├── themes/default/variables.css  # Design tokens — swap for different themes
    ├── marketing_[project].html
    ├── portfolio-card_[project].html
    ├── portfolio-card_[project].css   # Import to override your page styles
    └── assets/            # Screenshots
```

Nothing is written outside the project folder. No home directory access, no cloud uploads, no network calls.
